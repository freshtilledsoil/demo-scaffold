Demo Scaffold
=============

This is a work in progress. Not ready for use.

Scaffolding for building quick demos of tools, plugins and techniques. Uses Bourbon and Sass, run `rake server` to start watching the appropriate files. Requires Ruby 1.9.3 to work. Otherwise, just run `sass --watch css/sass:css -r ./css/sass/bourbon/lib/bourbon.rb`.
